# Persian Handwritten Digit Recognizer

A Deep Neural Network project trained to detect Persian handwritten digits from image. 

Training process have been done using C++ for faster learning and Hoda (handwritten Farsi digits dataset) have been used to train the network.

Online demo is available for testing trained neural network recognition interactively at URL:
